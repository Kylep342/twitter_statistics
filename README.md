# Twitter Statistics

![Alt text](git_images/@BarackObama.png?raw=true "Sample Plot")

Welcome to Twitter Statictics!

twitter_statistics is a small Python library that allows for graphing
of various natural language analyses of Twitter users' Tweets.

## How to Run

To run an analysis, simply modify the **instructions.yaml** file to include
as many Twitter handles as you need to analyze!

Then run `python main.py` and you've got your graphs!

If you would like to make any custom modifications to the code, feel free to
adjust which parts of speech are being filtered.

## To come

1. Filtering on multiple parts of speech.
2. Baseline methods that show hashtag and mention statistics.
3. Pettifying the charts generated by pyplot (I've only worked with it for ~30 mins :D)
